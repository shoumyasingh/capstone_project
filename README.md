Housepedia Real Estate Website

Housepedia is a digital real estate platform where realtors, agents, and home buyers can
connect to make a real estate purchase. Nowadays, 93% of home buyers in the United States use real estate websites to search for a home. 
Only 7% said they did not use online websites while looking for a home. As a result, nearly the entire sector went online. 
Real estate is undergoing significant change, and technology is the primary motivation for this change. 
For several years, the US real estate market has been entirely under the control of realtors. 
The goal of the Housepedia real estate platforms is to efficiently solve a user's problem: finding a new home quickly and efficiently. 

## To accomplish this, an app should
- Provide a sufficient number of property options for potential buyers.
- Allow users to find the best matching property.
- Make it possible to contact a real estate agent.
- Allow for efficient real estate research.
- Allow for Google navigation for property location.
